# MIPS Assembly Project

This repository contains a collection of programming problems solved using MIPS assembly language.  
Each problem demonstrates a different concept or operation in MIPS assembly.

## Folder Structure

There are 5 folders in this repository, each containing a different type of problems.

- `basics` contains problems that demonstrate basic operations like loading and storing values
- `memory_manipulation` contains problems that demonstrate memory operations
- `string_division_operations` contains problems that demonstrate string operations and division operations
- `functions` contains problems that demonstrate function calls and stack operations
- `floating_point_operations` contains problems that demonstrate floating point operations
- `problems` contains a variaty of problems that demonstrate different concepts

## Running the Problems

To run any of these problems, you will need a MIPS simulator like SPIM or MARS.  
Load the .s file into the simulator and run it.
